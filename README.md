METR4202_Billy_Mach2
====================

Final Lab for METR4202 2014. This Lab will incorporate the robot (Billy) created in Lab 1 and the Vision Software created in Lab 2 for the Microsoft Kinect allowing Billy to find items by himself and do whatever Surya requires, whether it be stacking or unstacking cups, sorting tea and coffee insta-mixes or "clinking" coffee with panach√©.
